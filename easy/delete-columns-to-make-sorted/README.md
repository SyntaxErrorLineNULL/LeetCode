Intuition

    Iterate through each index of all words at same time.
    Compare two indexes at a time and check for lexographical order.

Approach

    use nested for loop to iterate each index of all the words and compare the ASCII values to check lexograph order.

Complexity

    Time complexity:

O(n*m), depends on length of each word [m] and total number of words [n]

    Space complexity:

O(1), since fixed number of variables are used.
